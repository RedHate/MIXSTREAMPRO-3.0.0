	Enabled the sweepfx select function and added dualfilter and wash, now the fx select button has a 2ndary purpose. (only the top two control sweep fx, there are dualfilter and wash modes)
	
	*change* Set the "-" button to "parameter left" (used when setting loops / active loops)
	
	*change* Set the "+" button to "parameter right" (used when setting loops)
	
	*change* Set the "CUE" button for switching deck layers (quad decks is not fully implemented, this requires some more work please be paitent but enjoy)
	
	*change* Set the "Sampler" to the secondary option on the auto loop button (it makes more sense then set as roll)
	
	*change* Set the "Smart roll" to the secondary option of the roll button (it makes sense when you use it)
	
	Enabled 4 deck mode, 4 deck mode is not complete... it works however there are only 2 internal channels so decks a and b are being summed at the fader. Give me time....
	
	Enabled slicer mode and set it to: shift + saved loop
	
	Changed the "Scratch button" to a "Vinyl" button
		shift + scratch = Grid Cue Edit
		hold scratch = Grid Edit
		press to enable or disable scratch mode (no longer controls "smart scratch" SHE GONE!!!, once you disable it in the menu and reboot...)
	
	Shift + View will toggle through the 4 deck view modes.
